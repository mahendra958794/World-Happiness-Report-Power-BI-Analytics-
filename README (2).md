World Happiness Report – Power BI Analytics 
 Project Overview

This project presents an enterprise-level Power BI analytics report built on the World Happiness Dataset, covering 158 countries.
The goal is to understand global happiness patterns by analyzing economic, social, health, governance, and cultural factors through interactive dashboards and DAX-driven insights.


 Project Objectives

Compare happiness levels across countries and regions

Identify key drivers of happiness beyond GDP

Analyze inequalities between developed and developing regions

Study the role of trust, generosity, and social support

Evaluate data quality and unexplained (cultural) happiness


 Dataset Description

World Happiness Dataset includes:

Happiness Score & Rank

Economy (GDP per Capita)

Family (Social Support)

Health (Life Expectancy)

Freedom

Trust (Government Corruption)

Generosity

Dystopia Residual (Unexplained Happiness)

Standard Error (Survey Reliability)


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop – Dashboard development & visualization

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures, calculated columns, KPIs

Excel / CSV – Data source preparation


📈 Dashboard Overview
1️⃣ Global Happiness Overview

Global average, maximum, and minimum happiness

Happiness tier classification (High Joy / Moderate / Low Joy)

Regional happiness flow and top 10 happiest countries

Strong correlation between economy, health, and happiness

2️⃣ Economy & Health Indicators

GDP vs Happiness (diminishing returns beyond basic needs)

Wealth classification (Low Income, Developing, High Wealth)

Regional health leadership and life expectancy comparison

3️⃣ Social Support & Freedom Metrics

Impact of family support and personal freedom on happiness

Resilient countries where strong social bonds offset weak economies

Human Liberty Index (Family + Freedom)

4️⃣ Trust & Generosity Patterns

Trust in government as the weakest global happiness pillar

High happiness rarely exists without high trust

Generosity shown as a cultural trait, not wealth-dependent

5️⃣ Unexplained Joy & Data Quality

Dystopia Residual as a cultural baseline of happiness

Data precision analysis using standard error

Identification of regions needing better data collection


🔍 Key Insights

Economic strength and health are foundational drivers of happiness

Strong family support can compensate for low income

Trust in governance significantly boosts national happiness

Generosity is culturally influenced rather than income-driven

Happiness never drops to zero, even in the lowest-ranked nations


⭐ Key Features

Interactive slicers (Region, Happiness Tier, Wealth Class, Trust Level)

Advanced DAX calculations and KPI cards

Scatter plots, treemaps, waffle charts, ribbons, and heatmaps

Hierarchical drill-downs (Region → Country → Metrics)


📌 Limitations

Cultural bias in survey responses

Higher standard error in some regions

Static dataset limits predictive analysis


🚀 Future Enhancements

Time-series happiness trend analysis

Integration of mental health and education indicators

Predictive modeling and clustering

Automated policy recommendation summaries


✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI and DAX can transform global survey data into deep, multi-layered insights.
It highlights that happiness is multidimensional, driven by not just wealth, but also health, trust, social bonds, and culture, making it a powerful tool for policy analysis and global well-being research.
